# BotanistUseSoilPourers
A Schedule I quality of life mod. This mod makes Botanist use a soil pourer if it exists, this improves the time it takes for them to soil pots.

## Changes
- If a soil pourer has soil in it, the botanist will go straight to the pot and use the pourer instead of going to supply rack
- If a soil pourer has NO soil in it, the botanist will behave normally and go to supply shelf first, when at the pot, it will use the soil pourer instead of manually pouring
- Because of certain in-game mechanics, the soil pourers for botanists will be instantaneous so no animation is played, the soil pourer activated sound will still play
	- Soil pourers will behave normally for users

Works with multiplayer, per testing only the host needs the mod.

Pairs well with my other Botanist mod
